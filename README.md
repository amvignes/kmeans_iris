K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to group iris flowers from the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with four features for each sample: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Project Objective
The aim of this project is to further explore machine learning techniques, specifically unsupervised learning methods. By utilizing K-Means, I am enhancing my coding skills in Python while gaining a deeper understanding of clustering algorithms and their applications in data analysis.
K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into 'K' distinct clusters. The algorithm works by:
* Initializing 'K' centroids randomly.
* Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid based on distance.
* Recalculating the centroids as the mean of the points in each cluster.
* Iterating this process until convergence, where cluster assignments no longer change.
In this project, the K-Means algorithm is applied to the Iris dataset to identify inherent groupings among the different species of flowers based on their features. This approach allows for an exploration of the data's structure without relying on labeled outcomes.
Learning Experience
Through this project, I am developing a practical understanding of clustering techniques and their importance in data-driven decision-making. Implementing K-Means enhances my knowledge of machine learning concepts and prepares me for more advanced studies in unsupervised learning and data analysis.
